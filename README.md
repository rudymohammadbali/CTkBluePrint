# CTkBluePrint
 Build GUI apps faster with CTkBluePrint, simple user interface made for customtkinter. 

Note: This program is not 100% finished, so you may encounter some errors/bugs. It is also not optimized, which means the code has not been refactored. This was a project I worked on only in my free time, and now I don’t have time to complete it. Therefore, I’m publishing it. If you are kind, please make pull requests or send feedback so others can benefit.
